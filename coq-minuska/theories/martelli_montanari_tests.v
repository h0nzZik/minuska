(*
These examples are taken directly from the
Haskell implementation test suite. The Coq
results differ, but are equivalent. This
is caused by different picking of elements
between the implementations. However, the
resulting mgus of both implementation should
be directly equal.

The first test is a proof of concept, and the
second is a sanity check. More tests are pointless,
because, any mistakes will inherently be found out
during the proving of the rest of the implementation.
